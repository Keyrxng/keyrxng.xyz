title: "Web3 Faucet Service"
clientOrProject: "Ubiquity"
role: "Product Engineer"
year: "2023"
summary: "Gasless onboarding solution using OpenZeppelin Defender Relay in Cloudflare Workers with abuse-resistant verification. Fully functional but never deployed to production due to shifting priorities."
constraints: [
  "Gnosis Chain native xDAI required (not WXDAI)",
  "Zero server-side private key custody", 
  "Integration with existing Supabase user/permit schema",
  "Cloudflare Workers runtime limitations (fetch over axios)",
  "Tight delivery timeline with multiple reassignments"
]
approach: "Edge-deployed serverless faucet using Cloudflare Workers; multi-layer validation via Supabase for registered wallets and permit history; intelligent preflight checks for user and relayer balances; OpenZeppelin Defender Relay for secure gas subsidies; custom patches for Workers compatibility; structured JSON-RPC responses."
tech: ["Cloudflare Workers", "OpenZeppelin Defender Relay", "Supabase", "TypeScript", "Viem", "Custom fetch patches"]
wins: [
  "Eliminated first-transaction gas barrier for new contributors",
  "Abuse-resistant validation preventing duplicate subsidies",
  "Secure custody model with zero private key exposure",
  "Global edge deployment with predictable low latency",
  "Economically sustainable with ~$1 covering 10000 users"

### Problem
New bounty hunters completing their first task at Ubiquity DAO encountered "not enough gas to claim" errors when attempting to redeem payment permits on Gnosis Chain. This critical onboarding barrier prevented crypto-inexperienced developers from accessing earned rewards, effectively blocking legitimate contributors at the moment of first success.

### Approach
- **Secure gas relay**: OpenZeppelin Defender Relay to sponsor minimal xDAI transfers without private key custody
- **Edge deployment**: Cloudflare Workers for global availability with custom fetch-based patches for Defender compatibility
- **Multi-layer validation**: Supabase integration checking registered wallet existence and permit history to prevent abuse
- **Intelligent preflight**: Balance verification for both user eligibility and relayer funding before transaction execution
- **Developer experience**: Simple POST endpoint with JSON-RPC structured responses for consistent tooling integration

### Outcome
- **Technical success**: Fully functional gasless onboarding solution eliminating first-transaction barriers
- **Security achieved**: Zero private key custody with abuse-resistant validation via existing database schema
- **Production readiness**: QA endpoints with verifiable on-chain transactions and comprehensive error handling
- **Never deployed**: Complete implementation that never reached production due to shifting organizational priorities

### Constraints
- **Network specificity**: Native xDAI required on Gnosis Chain (not WXDAI token) to solve actual gas payment problems
- **Runtime limitations**: Cloudflare Workers environment requiring custom Defender client patches (fetch over axios)
- **Economic sustainability**: Per-user subsidy must remain small and configurable (~$1 covering 10000 users)
- **Abuse prevention**: Database-driven duplicate subsidy resistance via permit history tracking
- **Timeline pressure**: Multiple task reassignments and tight delivery deadlines

### Design choices
- **Validation-first architecture**: Database verification before any blockchain interaction to prevent failed transactions
- **Deterministic preflight checks**: Both user eligibility and relayer funding verification to avoid runtime failures
- **Environment-driven configuration**: Flexible claim fees, relay credentials, and network settings via environment variables
- **Consistent API design**: JSON-RPC response format for seamless integration with existing Ubiquity tooling
- **Edge-first deployment**: Global Cloudflare Workers distribution for predictable low-latency access

### Proof
Code excerpt — core transaction flow

```ts
const userBal = await relayer.call("eth_getBalance", [ethAddress, "latest"]);
if (userBal.result > env.CLAIM_FEE) {
  return makeRpcResponse({ error: { code: -32000, message: "Hunter has enough gas" } }, 400);
}

const relay_ = await relayer.getRelayer();
const relayBal = await relayer.call("eth_getBalance", [relay_.address, "latest"]);
if (relayBal.result < env.CLAIM_FEE) {
  return makeRpcResponse({ error: { code: -32000, message: "Faucet has no funds" } }, 400);
}

const tx = await relayer.sendTransaction({
  to: ethAddress,
  value: toHex(env.CLAIM_FEE),
  speed: "fast",
  gasLimit: 21000,
});
```

Code excerpt — database validation

```ts
const { data } = await supabase.from("wallets").select("address").eq("address", ethAddress);
if (!data || data.length === 0) {
  return makeRpcResponse({ error: { code: -32000, message: "Address not found" } }, 400);
}

const { data: permits } = await supabase
  .from("permits")
  .select("users(wallets(address))")
  .not("users", "is", null)
  .eq("users.wallets.address", ethAddress);
if (permits && permits.length > 0) {
  return makeRpcResponse({ error: { code: -32000, message: "Has likely been subsidized before." } }, 400);
}
```

QA evidence — comprehensive scenario testing

```text
# Already subsidized user (has permit)
res { jsonrpc: '2.0', error: { code: -32000, message: 'Has likely been subsidized before.' }, id: null }

# New user eligible for subsidy
res { jsonrpc: '2.0', result: { txHash: '0x3ca25068a7c59a190df4fb270e4e7348e46ec0b9e4b16f22ad19105b15c0dc58' }, id: null }

# User already has sufficient gas
res { jsonrpc: '2.0', error: { code: -32000, message: 'Hunter has enough gas' }, id: null }

# Verified transaction on-chain

Deployment configuration — Cloudflare Workers

```toml

main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2023-02-01"
node_compat = true

# Custom patches for OpenZeppelin Defender compatibility
[build]

# Environment variables for relay configuration
[env.production.vars]
CLAIM_FEE = "1000000000000000"  # 0.001 xDAI
SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
```
