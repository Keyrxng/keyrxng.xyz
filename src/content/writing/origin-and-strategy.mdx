## 1. First exposure (blink before push)
Early anxiety before the first open source PR (Anvil RPC UI) set a pattern: over-prepare privately, ship a coherent slice, treat review as collaborative not adversarial.

## 2. Stretch task: UUPS upgradeability
26 days later: migrating seven core contracts to UUPS (initializer migration, storage slot preservation, `_disableInitializers()`, audit-safe authorization). External audit surfaced zero findings—confidence shifted from "can submit" to "can be trusted under economic stakes".

## 3. Intentional lane expansion
Targeted three surfaces to maximize cross-surface leverage:
- Payment portal (latency + funds flow UX)
- Directory / task aggregation (data & workflow visibility)
- Kernel / automation (types, policy, context shaping)

## 4. Execution principles
| Principle | Short form |
|-----------|------------|
| Subtractive design | Remove unnecessary inference / calls / tokens first |
| Bounded uncertainty | Depth caps, timeouts, explicit exit criteria, token budgets |
| User never pays | Transparent retries / rotation; absorb transient failures |
| Deterministic envs | Fork + idempotent funding + stubs + loud logs |
| Thin slice iterate | Ship minimal viable reliability slice then harden |
| Captured rationale | Tiny ADR notes to prevent retroactive scope creep |

## 5. Pattern seeds (later reused)
- Type subtraction → union simplification & dynamic webhook enum mapping.
- Latency ranking → RPC handler & faster portal bootstrap.
- Token budgeting mindset → LLM context engineering & temporal resistance work.

## 6. Mentor influence (compressed)
Concise, surgical reviews reinforced prioritizing working slices over speculative rewrites.
