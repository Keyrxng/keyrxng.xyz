> Reference companion for readers new to the ecosystem context.

**Kernel (UbiquityOS / Ubiquibot)** — Automation core integrating GitHub webhooks, scheduling, and plugin execution.

**Plugin / Kernel Plugin** — Extendable module responding to kernel events (issues, PRs, comments) to execute automation logic.

**Worker (Cloudflare Worker)** — Edge runtime (V8 isolates) used for low-latency HTTP handling and lightweight compute; limited CPU and memory compared to full servers.

**GitHub Action (Workflow)** — GitHub-hosted CI runtime triggered by repository events; higher cold-start and latency overhead, suitable for longer or heavier tasks.

**Hybrid Architecture (Worker + Action)** — Pattern where a Worker handles fast path classification and dispatches heavier or privileged tasks to a self-triggered Action workflow.

**MTProto** — Telegram protocol for full account control (creating groups, managing chats) vs Bot API which has limited capabilities.

**Permit (ERC20 / ERC721 Permit Generation)** — Off-chain signed authorization enabling token approvals or transfer rights without a separate on-chain approval transaction.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call Endpoint)** — Blockchain JSON-RPC node endpoint; multiple endpoints are probed and ranked for latency and reliability.

**RPC Handler** — Library selecting and rotating between RPC endpoints transparently to mitigate single-endpoint failures.

**Deterministic Fork (Anvil / Foundry)** — Local blockchain state snapshot derived from a specific upstream RPC at a point in time, ensuring test reproducibility.

**ADR (Architectural Decision Record)** — Lightweight persistent document capturing problem, constraints, chosen solution, alternatives, and sunset criteria.

**Direction Freeze** — Explicit checkpoint signaling that strategic platform choices (runtime, data model) are locked for a phase to reduce churn.

**Silent Win** — Reliability success characterized by absence of incidents (no outages, reduced flakes) that otherwise risks being undervalued.

**Policy Surface** — User-facing commands or minimal UX gestures backed by deeper eligibility / authorization logic (e.g., `/start` task claim).

**Context Engineering (LLM)** — Intentional selection, ranking, and budgeting of textual artifacts (issues, diffs, references) to fit within model token limits without degrading answer quality.

**Depth Cap (LLM)** — Maximum recursion or link-following depth when gathering related context to prevent token overrun and hallucination risk.

**Optimistic Render** — UI technique rendering static or partially-known data immediately while resolving slower dynamic calls in the background.

**Test Funding Orchestration** — Automated script ensuring required accounts, allowances, and balances are set before E2E tests begin to remove environmental flakiness.
