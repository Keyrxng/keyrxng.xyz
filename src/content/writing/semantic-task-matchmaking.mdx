> Series linkage: This field note is the *catalyst* that led to Part I (diagnosis) and Part II (playbook) of the "Ghost in the Machine" series. It captures the raw observation—persistence without presence—and frames the narrative for stakeholders. See [Glossary](/writing/_glossary) for terminology.

## 1. Context: the triggering observation
During my tenure the company (Ubiquity) introduced an AI + RAG semantic task matchmaking layer: vector embeddings of past work, completed issues and tasks, driving “suggested / tagged” developer assignments atop Ubiquity OS. I have been absent >6 months. Yet in the latest metrics export (self-generated 2025-08-19) I remain the **second most semantically tagged contributor**.

Source table: `contributor_table.csv` (timestamp: 2025-08-19T22:21:54.761Z). Columns: *Merged PRs*, *Semantic Tags*, *Dormant windows*, etc.

## 2. Snapshot: tag distribution (evidence)
| Rank | Contributor | Semantic Tags | Merged PRs | Tags / Merged PR |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | gentlementlegen | 197 | 783 | 0.25 |
| 2 | **Keyrxng** | **74** | 136 | **0.54** |
| 3 | whilefoo | 47 | 119 | 0.39 |
| 4 | 0x4007 | 38 | 283 | 0.13 |
| 5 | shiv810 | 35 | 55 | 0.64 |
| 6 | ishowvel | 20 | 14 | 1.43* |

*\*Small denominator; high ratio but low absolute surface.*

- **Successors combined**: 35 + 3 = 38 (< my 74) despite recent inactivity.

## Condensed
Drivers, remediation formulas, and metrics now live in Ghost series Part I & II; this field note retains only the trigger and tag table.

*Legacy vector gravity reveals temporal resistance—this note records the spark.*
